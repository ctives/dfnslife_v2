# DFNS Life
My personal journey blog within the world of Self Defense.  Here I will chronicle getting in shape, mental preparedness,
firearms training and martial arts.

The primary purpose of using a blog for this is to hold myself accountable.  By making myself find material to
write about I will be forcing myself to continually learn.

Regards,

Tyler
