I just completed week 2 of my 5x5 Stronglifts program.  I have been using the app by Stronglifts to be my guide as well.
The simplicity of this program has been a blessing and curse so far.  One part of me really likes that I only have to 
worry about 5 different movements and only working out 3 days a week.  The other part of me has me constantly wondering 
if I should be doing more.  My off days right now are Tue, Thu, Sat and Sun.  I have been filling in my Tue and Thu with 
random excersices and I haven't come up with a routine that I am comfortable with.  If I lift on Tue or Thu I have to be 
carefull to not jeopordize my recovery from my 5x5 training.  So I have been doing body weight circuit workouts and yoga
as a way to keep my body moving and also try to induce some active recovery.

I modified the suggested weight that the app provided for the squats, bench press and rows.  I think I might have modified
it a bit too much as the squats are already starting to get hard.  I will be hitting my previous max PR in week 5.  The
one way I justify myself is that I have been training with weights for over 3 years.  The part that has me worried is that
my squat weight does not align with my deadlift weight.  I am currently at 40% of my max deadlift while my squat is at 75%.
I probably should of adjusted my deadlift in order for the two exercises to compliment each other.

A few days ago I posted about using meditation as a tool for improving performance of my body.  I have tried it twice 
now and found it very hard.  I meditate for 10 minutes before I head to the gym.  My hope is that it 
will help me focus on my lifts for the 5x5 program. Meditation also has many other benefits beyond exercise that is has 
me convinced that I should be doing it everyday.

<h2>Overall Impression</h2>
<p>
So far I have been happy with the program.  I do not think it is fair to judge the program until I start hitting 
personal bests.  The whole point of this experament was to get through that barrier that I have been unable to pass.  I
feel as long as I do my part the numbers should come. My diet will have to get better.  I have not put much 
effort into making sure I take in the right number of calories and having enough protein to build muscle.  2 weeks from
now it will be critical that I am eating right.
