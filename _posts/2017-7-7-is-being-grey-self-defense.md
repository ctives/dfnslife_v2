I recently became interested in the concept of "going grey" or being a "grey man" and whether it can be a form of everyday
self-defense.  My question is, what benefits will I have if I follow the rules of becoming grey?  First, we need to discuss what it means to become grey.
</p>


<p>
<h2>What is a Grey Man? </h2>
A grey man/woman is a person who can blend into the crowd.  Blending among people makes them effectively invisible to 
predators.
</p>

<p>
Doing a fair amount of reading and listening to a few podcasts regarding the art, I learned a few basic concepts.
</p>

<h2>Tips for becoming grey</h2>


<h3>Dress code</h3>
<p>
 Dress how the locals dress.  If you work downtown in the financial district, then dress like you work there.  You need 
 to be sure that the clothes match the current fashion trends.  I am not saying the suit needs to match what Brad Pitt 
 is wearing on the cover of GQ magazine. I am saying the fashion should match what 90% percent of the folks around
 you are wearing. On the other end of the spectrum, if you are on vacation in Belize City, Belize; you might want to shop
 is the local stores to wear what the locals are wearing.  Avoid the tourist clothing stores at all costs.  Nothing says
 look at me more than wearing a bright red t-shirt saying, "I Love Shark Rey Alley".
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Wearing tactical clothing is a big red flag to predators. The 5.11 pants, molle backpack, Oakley glasses and tactical
 watch just screams "I got cool shit and I may know something important".  This one is a bit easier for me as I do not 
 dress tactical.  I do wear Oakley sunglasses but I like to think they are more of the surfer SoCal variety and not 
 tactical.
 </p>
 
 <h3>How you act</h3>
 <p>
 The key here is to behave average and non-threatening.  The more it looks like you don't know anything and that you are
 just going about your normal day to day business the better.  Keep your eye contact to a minimum will minimize the chance
 of having someone notice you.  The eye contact tends to create a connection between two people and that is the last thing
 needed.  When speaking with people, limit the contact and do not volunteer information that might expose you.
 </p>
 
 <p>Despite acting like you are going about your normal business, you need to be aware of your surroundings.  The key is not exposing your level of awareness.  Be careful when scanning rooms for people and emergency exits.  Do not reveal
 looks behind you. </p>
 
 <h3>How you move</h3>
 <p>
 Know the local landscape. Be prepared to use alternative routes to your destination.  Do not travel to locations where bad
 things may happen.
 </p>
 
 <p>When you move, go with the flow.  Walk the same speed as those around you.  Drive with the flow of traffic.  It is
 paramount that you move like everyone around you.  Rapid movement will expose you to predators. </p>
 
 <h3>Watch others</h3>
 <p>
 The concept of "Learning to see the grey man" outlined by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.itstactical.com/intellicom/mindset/gray-man-strategies-101-peeling-away-the-thin-veneer-of-society/">itstactical</a>,
 appears to be a very helpful drill in understanding what gets picked up by our eyes and ears as a threat.  Understanding
 what triggers those responses will help you better adapt yourself to not create triggers.  Plus, it sounds like a bit of 
 fun that I plan to practice on my lunch breaks at work.
 </p>
 
 <h2>In conclusion</h2>
 <p>
 The grey man concept seems to be an effective tool in decreasing the chance of you being singled out by a predator.  Probably
 the most important concept to subscribe to in self-defense is avoiding the fight.  Avoiding conflict
 should be just as important and preparing for conflict. With practice these are skills that we can apply quickly with
 minimal cost.
 </p>
 
 <p>The list is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to how to become grey, but more of a primer of what to expect.  I 
 plan to learn more about this subject in the future.</p>
 
<p>
Stay vigilant, stay classy
