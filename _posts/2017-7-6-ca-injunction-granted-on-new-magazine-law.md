California gun owners got a small win on June 29, 2017 and they should thank Judge Roger Benitez for it. On July 1, 2017
any Californian with possession of a magazine greater than 10 rounds would become a criminal.  The injunction puts a 
hold on that law until due process can occur. Several politicians had to following to say in response.

{% include quote.html quote="These large-capacity magazines are disproportionately used in crime, and feature 
    prominently in some of the most serious crime, including homicides, mass shootings, and killings of law enforcement 
    officers." author="State Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra" %}

{% include quote.html quote="Large-capacity magazines serve only one purpose: efficient and effective mass murder,"
    author="Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom" %}
    
<p>
My response to them would be that banning the magazines will only affect the law abiding citizen and they are the constant
victims of the violent crimes, homicides and mass shootings.  Laws like this are taking power away from the people to
protect themselves. How many mass shootings could have been stopped had there been someone armed to fight back.

Judge Benitez brings up several good points on why he granted the injunction.
</p>

{% include quote.html quote="California’s gun laws are complicated. Proposition 63 adds one more layer of complexity. 
Perhaps too much complexity"  author="Judge Roger Benitez" %}

{% include quote.html quote="The California matrix of gun control laws is among the harshest in the nation and are filled
with criminal law traps for people of common intelligence who desire to obey the law. "  author="Judge Roger Benitez" %}

{% include quote.html quote="Ultimately, this case asks two questions. “Does a law-abiding responsible citizen
have a right to defend his home from criminals using whatever common magazine size he
or she judges best suits the situation? Does that same citizen have a right to keep and
bear a common magazine that is useful for service in a militia?. "  author="Judge Roger Benitez" %}

<p>
This case is not over, but I hope it sheds a light on what politicians have been doing in California for the past 20 years.
They have wasted the tax payers time and money perusing a false ideology that if guns are outlawed the world would be a 
safer place.  I am willing to wager my bottom dollar that if guns are outlawed, it would not stop criminals and terrorists
from using guns. I will also bet that there is not a police force large enough to protect
you against those threats.  Even if California was printing money out of its you know what, it could not keep you safe.

The real solution is empowering the people. Stop stripping the people's civil right of protecting one's self. I don't
think your local law enforcement department would disagree with me.  Well, maybe some agency chiefs in the San Francisco bay area might.

Stay vigilant, stay classy
