Recently the Supreme Court denied review of the 9th Circuit Decision in "Peruta v. County of San Diego". Justice Thomas 
and Justice Gorsuch being the only dissenters. This comes as a huge blow to 2nd Amendment advocates who feel that the 
2nd Amendment receives different treatment compared to other amendments. 
</p>

<p>
I live in San Diego county and the local sheriff proscribes concealed carry permits on a "good cause" basis. This means 
that a law-abiding citizen needs to show "good cause" in their application to be granted a permit. The law-abiding 
citizen's "personal safety" is not enough to satisfy the requirements. The applicant must show “a set of circumstances 
that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and cause him to be placed in harm’s way.” Because the average 
citizen is unable to distinguish themselves in need that is greater than any other citizen they will not qualify for a 
concealed carry permit. 
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Amendment is treated as second hand citizen. One common argument I hear is that our forefathers never envisioned
 semi-automatic weapons with high capacity magazines. I would argue that our forefathers did envision our right to 
 protect our lives and our freedom from tyrannical power by using the weapons available at that time. In 1791 when the 
 Bill of Rights was ratified and which contained our first ten amendments the highest tech weapon at the time was the 
 "Long Rifle". This weapon was used by hunters and soldiers alike and would be the equivalent of our modern-day AR-15. 
 The long rifle help free the United States from foreign control by standing toe-to-toe with the British Army's musket. 
 The AR-15 would be able to satisfy this same requirement in today's modern landscape of firearms.

{% include quote.html quote="As we explained in Heller, to “bear arms” means to ‘wear, bear, or carry upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.’ " author="Thomas, J" %}

<p>
The Supreme Court clearly ignored "Heller v. District of Columbia" in this case. The San Diego County Sheriff's office 
and the State of California can continue to make arbitrary decisions on who can bear arms. The right to bear arms 
originated from the idea to bear arms in public in some manner. Our forefathers did not envision the people defending 
themselves from the confines of their bedroom only. 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the Supreme Court was correct in not taking this case because the argument was flawed. The argument that the 
San Diego County Sheriff's department cannot regulate the concealed carry permit process is flawed. An argument 
regarding the firearms laws in California along with the San Diego County Sheriff removing the rights of its citizens 
to bear arms outside their homes may have been sounder.

I want to end this with one final quote from Justice Thomas:
</P>

{% include quote.html quote="For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded
                             constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the
                             guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated
                             and superfluous. But the Framers made a clear
                             choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear
                             arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by
                             idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly
                             when their very lives may depend on it. I respectfully
                             dissent." author="Thomas, J" %}
