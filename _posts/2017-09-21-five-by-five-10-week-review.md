<p>The 5x5 program is getting tough. In the beginning the prescribed weight was too light. The program starts you light 
by design because it gets heavy fast. The program is working but I wish I did not modify the prescribed numbers now.</p>

<p>When I first started, I massaged some numbers because I felt they were too light. For example, I modified the bench 
press, squat and deadlift to a number that would not make look like a newb in the gym. The problem I found later was 
that I was not benefiting for the other lifts to help make me stronger. When I was doing, bench press I was not getting 
the gains from doing the overhead press 2 days prior. I was too light on the overhead press to really be much help while 
I was struggling to finish my prescribed bench press numbers. If I did not modify the numbers, by the time the bench 
press was getting heavy the overhead press would have also been helping my chest muscles. A similar argument could be 
made about the deadlift and squat. My deadlift was much too light while my squat got heavy too fast.
</p>
 
 <p>The squat has seen some nice gains and I have set a personal best at 240 pounds. For the longest time, I could not 
 get past 225 pounds at 80% effort. The deadlift has a long way to go before I reach my previous best. I had my first 
 failure in overhead press on Wednesday. I hope to hit the 5x5 next time I do that movement. I also saw my first-row 
 failure on Monday as well. I have also set a PR at the row for 155 pounds. Finally, the bench press, my arch nemesis 
 has forced me to start using 1.5 pound plates. The app saw that I had failed 3 times in a row and recommended I start 
 going up in 2 pound increments. I decided to go up in 3 pound increments instead because I found a good deal on 1.5 
 pound plates on Amazon.
</p>
 
 <p>I have cut out most of my cardio because I felt I needed the extra day to recover from the exercises. The problem 
 with that is that I have gained 5 pounds since I started. I think I will have to go into a cutting phase here soon 
 because that is a little too much fat for my liking. I also was not as lean as I wanted to be when I started.
</p>
 
 <p>Overall the program is working. I am happy with the results. It is definitely hard work. Once it got heavy, I was 
 exhausted after it workout. I would like to add some cardio soon, but I want to get my bench press a bit higher first.
