<p>
The Department of Justice's second attempt at drafting regulation for weapons with bullet buttons in California has been
rejected by State of California Office of Administrative Law.

<p>
What does this mean for us? The DOJ will make another attempt but this just delays the process.  We still will need to 
register guns that are classified as "assault weapons".  The deadline to register an "assault weapon" has been extended
to July 1, 2018.
