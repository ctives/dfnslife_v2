<p>As I have been researching ways to improve my body I have frequently seen the reference to meditation and focused 
breathing as a method to improve athletic performance.  I have also mentioned in the past my interest in the psychology
of mortal combat and being prepared mentally to protect yourself.  Research has shown that meditation can improve both
training and <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/149615/Improving_Military_Resilience_through_Mindfulness_Training" target="_blank">
preparation for combat</a>.  There are several aspects of meditation that the everyday person can leverage to improve
their own performance. </p>  


<h2>Decreases stress</h2>
Stress has a negative impact on the brain.  A study by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527522" target="_blank">
Journal of Health Psychology</a> revealed that meditation lowers stress and reduces the stress hormone cortisol. A brain 
that can relax under stressful situations will have a positive impact on the body's physical performance. 

<h2>Improves concentration</h2>
Staying focused on the task at hand has many benefits in the world of self-defense.  If your mind is clear while you are 
doing your deadlift your body can maintain form and push a better lift.  You may have experienced this at the gym which 
often gets described as "having a good day" or "being in the zone".  Your body feels good and your mind is focused.  You
are not thinking about your annoying neighbor or that deadline you have at work.  That same concentration level
is helpful with other forms of training as well. <a href="http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920753,00.html">
A Time magazine article</a> talked about how the US military is using meditation to improve soldiers "better aim on the 
shooting range, higher test scores, enhanced ability to handle combat stress and slip back into life at home".  The 
 results appear to be impressive.

<h2>Slows aging</h2>
Death will eventually get us all but that does not mean we cannot try to keep it at bay if we can.  Meditation
has been shown to change the physiology of the brain as well. People that meditate have more 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter">grey matter</a> (ie. brain cells) and have longer 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere" target="_blank">telomeres</a>. People who live a healthy lifestyle
also have longer telomeres. It would not be hard to make the conclusion that the same population that meditate also 
exercise frequently and eat a healthy diet.

<h2>Become self-aware</h2>
Meditation is known to improve the mind-body connection. By solidifying that connection, you can maximize your
performance.  Meditation increases the brain signaling to the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for positive
emotion. That positivity helps improve our own acceptance which improves our well-being.  The more positive we feel the
better we can handle adverse situations.

<h2>Whatâ€™s next</h2>
I plan to use meditation to help me focus on my training.  I often find myself distracted when I am at the gym and even
at work.  I think if I can learn to quiet my mind, I will see performance gains in all aspects of my life.  My first 
attempt at meditation was a failure.  I set the timer on my phone for 10 mins and I was already thinking about 
sending a text message within 30 seconds of closing my eyes.  All my research has indicated that it is challenging and
that meditation requires a lot of practice.

Ideally, I would like meditation to accelerate my growth in fitness and self-defense training.  I am not a 18 year old kid, 
so I need all the help that I can get.  I will report back frequently on my progress with my meditation progress.

Stay vigilant, stay classy.
