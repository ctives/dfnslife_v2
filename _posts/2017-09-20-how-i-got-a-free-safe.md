<p>Part of my quest to study self-defense is training with firearms. I grew up around guns but since I moved out of my 
parents’ house when I was in college my exposer to firearms dropped to nothing. It was not until I was married and had 
my first child that I realized I wanted to share the same experiences that I had with my dad with my son. It also did 
not help that it was during the Obama administration and the assault on the 2nd Amendment was well underway. Even worse 
I live in California which has the most aggressive and unconstitutional 2nd Amendment laws in the union. Another hurtle 
to my 2nd Amendment exercising quest my wife does not like guns. She is okay with my shooting guns, reading about guns 
and talking about guns, but she does not like the idea of having a firearm in our house. For there to be a firearm in my 
house, there had to be every precaution taken to prevent access to my future firearms from my kids. Yes, I am in the 
market to buy my first gun but I must have a secure location for them before this guy can pass go.

<p>I get to reap the benefits of my wife's job occasionally, and this time it was huge, literally and figuratively. My 
wife works in the construction industry and they are currently demolishing an old hotel in San Diego. The owners of the 
land donated all the contents of the hotel to a local non-profit and whatever was not taken was left to the demolishing 
contractor to salvage and sell. One item that was not attractive to both the non-profit and the salvage company was this 
old safe. No one wanted it because it was too old and heavy to move. It weighs over a thousand points and does not have 
good street value. The timing was impeccable. The only thing it has costed me so far is I had to pay a company to move 
it. Unfortunately, moving a thousand-pound safe is not the cheap, but I still come out ahead of buying a similar new 
safe with similar theft and fire rating. I think it looks cool next to my grandfather's old workbench.
</p>

<p>Another hidden benefit of buying this safe is it forced me to clean up my garage. It is kind of like when you move 
and are forced to decide if an item it worth moving or getting rid of. I ended up removing a bunch of clutter out of my 
garage and now it’s a much better place to work and clean my future guns.
