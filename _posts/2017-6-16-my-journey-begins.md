The fear of getting punched in the face had me contemplating what my next steps should be.  Through countless nights of reading and premeditating I have come to the realization that I just need to take one step forward.  That one step starts with this blog post.  I am embarking on a journey to learn what I need to know to protect my family.
</p>
<p>
I plan to study self-defense and proven solutions.  I will then apply those solutions to myself.  By creating this blog I hope to document and to teach others about my journey.
</p> 
<p>
I am a student and not an expert.  A student can teach if that student has knowledge that may be useful to anothers.  Through studying, practicing and hopefully competition I will make the mistakes and gain knowledge.  I will be focused on 4 key aspects.
</p> 
<p>
First will be martial arts.  I plan to research what makes sense for me.  I am a 38-year-old male who is married with 2 kids.  I live in San Diego, California and both my wife and I work full time. My life situation will dictate my areas of focus.
</p> 
<p>
Secondly, physical fitness will be important.  I have always been physically active since my mid-twenties so this is the only aspect of self-defense that I may be prepared for.  There is no use in trying to stand your ground or even run away if you are going to be overpowered or chased down by your attacker.
</p> 
<p>
Third, mental preparation.  I do not know how I will become mentally prepared for violence.  Hopefully training and muscle memory will help. Stress of competition may be another tool.  The psychology of self-defense will be a subject I plan to study a lot.
</p> 
<p>
Finally, weapons.  The use of a weapon is a force multiplier.  A weapon is the best way to get yourself out of a deadly situation alive.  There are lethal and non-lethal solutions and they will be looked at here.  I do plan to focus more on firearms for home defense.  Unfortunately, I live is California which does not have friendly firearm laws.  Concealed carry is not an option for me because of the county I live in.  Alternatives can be blades, non-lethal weapons and my body.
</p> 
<p>
Let the journey begin.
