<h2>Why use a flashlight for self defense</h2>
<p>
I never thought that a flashlight could be used for self defense but there 
appears to some evidence that suggests otherwise.  A flashlight can be an effective
tool to deter and even fend off an attacker.  So how can a flashlight be used for 
self defense?
</p>

<h2>"My flashlight saved my life!"</h2>
<p>
Here are a few points that make a flashlight a valuable part of my self-defense ideology.
</p>

<h4>Reveal the threat</h4>
<p>
We use flashlights to see better in the dark.  Flashlights helps avoid hazards 
that we may not be able to see otherwise. This same logic applies to a would
be attacker.  If we can see our threat from a farther distance we can avoid the 
situation completely. 
</p>

<h4>Disorient the threat</h4>
<p>
Our threat is likely hiding or stalking us in the dark.  Their eyes have adapted to the current
lighting conditions.  A flash of a 100+ lumen flashlight would force the threat's eyes to
undilate and temporarily blind the attacker. Allowing you to escape (the ideal situation) 
or giving your a chance to fight back.  With some of the higher powered lights, you can even 
temporarily blind someone in broad daylight. 
</p>

<h4>Striking tool</h4>
<p>
A flashlight can also be used as a striking tool.  If you have ever owned a 3 C or D cell Maglite, you
know that light would make an excellent baton in a self-defense situation. In fact the use of a Maglite
 as a baton is nothing new. The smaller tactical
flashlights often come with a bezel that is designed for striking an opponent. I am not sure if the 
striking bezel has an advantage over a light that does not.  I think that it should at least
cut the attacker more.  Striking someone with a flashlight is better than just using your hand. You need
to take any advantage you can possibly take against your attacker.
</p>

<h4>50 State Legal</h4>
<p>
As of this writing, carrying a flashlight is legal in all 50 states and can be transported across state
lines without a permit. When you carry a flashlight you are not going to get odd looks from strangers at
your favorite restaurant or conveniance store.  
</p>

<h2>What makes a good self defense flashlight</h2>
<p>
There are several common features that I consider good for a self defense flashlight.
</p>

<h4>Durable Material</h4>
<p>
A good flashlight is built from a durable material.  We often see these flashlights made from aircraft grade aluminum or
polymer.  We want to make sure that the light will not break after being dropped or dissintergrates in our hands after the 
first strike.  Most flashlights labeled as "tactical" are built using a durable material.  Again, do your research on the 
specifications of the flashlight as well as read reviews.  There are too many sources for you to not make an informed 
decision.
</p>

<h4>Bezel</h4>
<p>
The light should have a bezel.  The bezel protects the lens from drops and blows.  I do not think it is required to have
one of the tactical bezels.  At a minimum the bezel should be strong enough to withstand abuse and still work after being
used as a striking weapon. 
</p>

<h4>Light Output</h4>
<p>
The light must at least be 100 lumens. That appears to be enough to make someons eyes to undilate. There are plenty of 100+
lumens lights that are considered affortable.  If I was in the market I want to buy as much lumens that I can afford.  If only
I could afford a light that would melt eyeballs.
</p>

<h4>Water resistant</h4>
<p>
We do not want our light breaking on a rainy day.  If we want to carry a light everywhere we go, it has to be able to
handle daily life.  I can see daily situations of being caught in a rain storm, falling in the toilet or one of my kids
thinking it would be cool to take daddy's new flashlight into the bathtub. We do not want to be in the situation where our flashlight
no longer works because it corroded from the inside after the bathtub incident.
</p>


<h2>Flashlights</h2>

This is not an exhaustive list, but the brands listed below are well respected within the industry.  Each manufacture
has a wide range of products that may better suit your needs.  I suggest doing your research and finding the healthy 
compromise of price and function.

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

Use a light that you are comfortable carrying daily.  I personally need the light to fit in my pocket
or else I will not carry it.  I do not like items clipped onto my belt because I feel like I look like a nerd.  Do your 
research and figure out what works for you. Do not hesitate practicing the deployment of your light either.  Practice
striking if you are comfortable with the durability of the light.  As you get comfortable with the deployment of your
flashlight as a defense tool, the higher the probably of you using it in a stressful situation.
