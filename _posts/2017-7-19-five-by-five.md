I have officially adopted the 5x5 as my strength program.  I am tired of my current program of me guessing what I need 
to do next to get bigger muscles.  Over the past year, I have gone on a journey that seems to be familiar with many 
people that go to the gym. I go almost every day and do my set of routines.  I may start to build some strength but 
then I eventually plateau or even regress.  Often the reason for the regress is that I get sick or hurt or I am trying 
to cut weight.  Let’s do a recap from a year ago. 

<h2>1 Year ago</h2>

I was doing CrossFit then.  I was enjoying the sense of community but I had stopped seeing progress. There were several 
reasons for the lack of progress and the biggest was diet.  I was not eating enough of the right foods.  I was too 
concerned with getting fat so I would limit my calories. But, I would mess it all up by indulging in sweets and beer 
several times a week.  I justified my poor consumption habits by saying that I work out so I can eat what I want.  In 
fact, I have several friends that do the same thing.  We all are each other’s support group.

I was only going to my local CrossFit gym 3 times a week which was another reason I did not see progress. Because I was 
not progressing as fast as I would like I started lifting weights on my off days.  To my pleasure, I felt I was getting 
stronger.  I continued to follow the program of lifting weights 2 days a week along with CrossFit 3 days a week for 3 
months. I liked the progress so I quite CrossFit so that I could focus on weight lifting.

By September of 2016, I was strictly lifting.  I was eating a ton of protein but again my diet was not that great.  
Every time I felt like I was getting too fat I would cut my diet.  When I would cut my diet, my progress would reverse.  
The holidays came and my diet got even worse.  By January 2017, I was 215lbs and not any stronger than in September when 
I weighed 195lbs. Here are some of the numbers I pulled from my journal:

Looking at the results, I am 5lbs heavier and I am weaker in 3 of the 4 lifts listed.  That is a lot of time spent at 
the gym with very little to show for it. 

<h2>What is the 5x5?</h2>

The 5x5 program is nothing new and can be traced back 100 years.  It has gained popularity recently because of its 
simplicity.  The concept is that you work on compound lifts like squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press and 
barbell row.  Compound lifts work several muscles at the same time and help the program’s efficiency by being a complete 
body workout. It is recommended that you only workout 3 times a week because you need the time in between for your body 
to recover.  A sample program looks like this:

          <th>Reps</th>
      </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
         <tr>
             <td>Squat</td>
             <td>5x5</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <td>Overhead Press</td>
             <td>5x5</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <td>Deadlift</td>
             <td>5x5</td>
         </tr>                           
     </tbody>
    </table>

The following week the workout gets changed a little by moving last week’s Wednesday workout to Monday and Friday and 
last week’s Monday and Friday to Wednesday.  The routine switches back and forth week after week.  There is even a free 
app you can use if you feel it is too complicated.

The other key to the 5x5’s success as that when you complete a movement’s 5x5 the next time you do that movement the 
weight increases.  If on Wednesday I finished my 150lbs. squat 5x5 then on Friday I must do a 155lb. squat.  Weight 
increases in 5lbs increments except for the deadlift where it will go up by 10lb. Because the weight is increased so 
fast it is recommended to start light.  You need to focus on your form now because it will be much hard when you are 
approaching failure.

So, I made the commitment and started the program.  Here is what I am starting with and my stretch goal 12 months from now.

I plan on following this program for at least a year. My hope is this year of training is more successful than last year.  My biggest enemy will be my diet.  I need to focus on creating a calorie surplus but not to the extent that I am getting too fat and demotivating myself.  I also need to make sure my protein intake is enough to build muscle. I will check in periodically to update on my progress. 

Stay vigilant, stay classy
