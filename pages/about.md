<p>
Join me as I pursue the life of making self-defense a life style. Have you ever wondered if you had the skill to
defend your life? Prior to becoming a father I had not put much thought into a life threatening situation. As soon as I
held my oldest son in my hands my life changed forever. Immediately I thought my most important mission was making a
safe environment for my famuily.</p>

<p>
My wife and children are my life responsibility. Through education and training I hope to improve my
self-defense skills. </p>

<p>
Join me as I embark on this journey of self exploration. Let my triumphs and failures help guide you on your own
personal journey.</p>

Best,<br>
Tyler Ives
